# 1D-Chess

1d-chess is a chess variant where you can play the beautiful game without all those unneccessary and complicated extra dimensions. Play as white against the AI. You might initally find it more difficult than expected, but assming optimal play, is there a forced win for white?

*Note:*

This chess variant was first described by Martin Gardner in the Mathematical Games column of the July 1980 issue of Scientific American, see the [column on JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24966361)
